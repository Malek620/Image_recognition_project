# Image_recognition_project
In this notebook, we'll go through the code a neural network to predict what is contained within the image
(airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck). We will go through the following in this notebook:
  
Exploring and Processing the Data
  
Building and Training our Convolutional Neural Network
  
Testing out with our own images

In this project we will use the CIFAR-10 Dataset which is aleardy implemented in Keras.datasets , The details of the dataset are as follows:

Images to be recognized: Tiny images of 32 * 32 pixels

Labels: 10 possible labels (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck)

Dataset size: 60000 images, split into 50000 for training and 10000 for testing
