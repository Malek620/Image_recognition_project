# Image_recognition_project
In this notebook, we'll go through the code a neural network to predict what is contained within the image
(airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck). We will go through the following in this notebook:
  
Exploring and Processing the Data
  
Building and Training our Convolutional Neural Network
  
Testing out with our own images
